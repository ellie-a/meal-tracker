A web app that allows the user to enter in meals they have consumed for the day to track their calories. It also allows them to edit the entries, and search for their low and high calorie meals.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Download this repo using your terminal: git clone https://github.com/ellie-a/meal-tracker

2. Use npm install and bower install in the top level of the project directory in the terminal  to retrieve packages used ex:
    $npm install
    $bower install

3. View the code by drag-and-dropping the file into your [favorite text editor](https://atom.io)
    If you don't have the atom package for typescript I highly suggest it. Install globally by using the command : apm install atom-typescript
